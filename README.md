# CS229: Machine Learning (2018 Autumn)

This repository contains the course materials from Stanford introductory Machine Learning course: CS229.

### About the Course

The official course page is [here](https://cs229.stanford.edu/).

The videos of all lectures are available on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU).

### Motivation

My motivation is to provide people who are self-studying this course a sample solution to the problem sets, so that when they get stuck they know where to look for hints.
