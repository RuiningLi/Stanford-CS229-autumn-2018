# CS229: Machine Learning (2018 Autumn)

This repository contains the course materials from Stanford introductory Machine Learning course: CS229.

### About the Course

The official course page is [here](https://cs229.stanford.edu/).

The videos of all lectures are available on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU).

### Motivation

In order to limit access to the assignments to only enrolled students, Stanford didn't post the assignments publicly. However, (I found) the assignments are really helpful in gaining a deeper understanding of the topics covered in the class and an opportunity to implement various learning algorithms from scratch. Therefore, I decided to publish the assignments, as well as my solutions to them, here!
